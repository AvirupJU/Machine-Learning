# Machine-Learning
Contains machine learning algorithms. I've tried to code the algorithms from scratch with bare minimum python packages for a better understanding of what ACTUALLY goes on under the hood. 
1. Linear Regression - Building a regressor and implementing gradient descent from scratch.
2. SVM - Building a simple support vector machine from scratch that classifies a set of points based on the given features. To keep it simple I've designed it for binary classification only. Stochastic gradient descent has been used here.
3. Basic ML: Using SciKitLearn
  a. Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression.
  b. Iris Classification using KNN Classifier.
  
4. StockPricePredictor - SVM are usually used for classification byt they can be also used for tackling regression problems. Impelemented three SVRs to predict stock prices of Apple and the Radial Basis Function fits the data points most accurately.
